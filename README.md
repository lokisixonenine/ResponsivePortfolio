# ResponsivePortfolio
This is week 2's homework where we are assigned to recreate the porfolio from Week 1 using the following parameters:
- Same three pages as before: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html
- site must include:
    - navbar
    - responsive layout
    - responsive images
- site should minimize the use of media queries

Some hints for completing this assignment:
- Use bootstraps grid system (base 12) for containers, rows, columns
- on xs screens, content should take up the entire screen. on sm or larger screens, it should have some margins on the left and right sides

Minimum Requirements for this assignment:
- Functional, deployed application
- GitHub Repository and README describing the project

Bonus item: using bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on this site

Developer's notes:
- I will basically just be copying over the code from my previous homework's html files and will be incorporating bootstrap.
